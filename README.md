# Backend Assessment Evermos

## Description
In this repository I have completed 3 tasks to fulfill my vocation in a company called [Evermos] (https://evermos.com/),

First, I made a simple game like Pacman, but there is a little extra, namely pacman treasure hunting. I made this application using python even though I have problems in that but I can finish this simple game.

Second, I made an application about tennis ball players, where in this application it is required to fill the container until it is full so that the player can start the game whenever he is ready to play it. Initially I have made this application using python but it has limitations
 in my knowledge become a barrier to it. therefore I made this application using php with the laravel framework because I am very skilled in this matter.

Third, I built a small online shop with a flash sale feature so that buyers can buy products at low prices. I was planning to build the application using python but it was the same as the 2nd task, so I change my mind and i built it using php with laravel framework

##My Fault
I made a mistake in creating a repository, it should be 1 repository for 1 task, in this repository I created it for 3 tasks so it was very difficult to set it up and it was my fault.
